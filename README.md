## Report
My report (available in [french](https://github.com/LounesMD/Stage2021_RL/blob/main/CompteRendu.pdf) or in [english](https://www.google.com)) proposed an in-dept study of the algorithms used. Note that the algorithms are not written because they are easily found on the internet. For my part, my work was based on this document : [Reinforcement Learning](https://philippe-preux.github.io/Documents/digest-ar.pdf).
