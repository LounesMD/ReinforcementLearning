# Reinforcement Learning
## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of several reinforcement learning algorithms, must read papers/books and questions (of any kind).

In addition, I keep this repository updated with my thoughts and future work (mainly to answer the question: How to improve reinforcement learning for non-stationary environments).<br>
The long term goal of this repository is to be the must-have of GitHub Reinforcement Learning repository (RL Algo, environments, papers, etc).

## Report
A first report (available in [french](https://github.com/LounesMD/Stage2021_RL/blob/main/CompteRendu.pdf) and soon in [english]()) proposed an in-dept study of some of the algorithms used. Note that the algorithms are not written because they are easily found on the internet. For the first version of the report, my work was based on this document : [Reinforcement Learning](https://philippe-preux.github.io/Documents/digest-ar.pdf).
