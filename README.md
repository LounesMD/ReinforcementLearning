# Reinforcement Learning
## Overview
This repository provides an implementation of several reinforcement learning algorithms, must read papers/books and questions (of any kind).

</p>


In addition, I keep this repository updated with my thoughts and future work (mainly to answer the question: How to improve reinforcement learning for non-stationary environments).<br>
The long term goal of this repository is to be the must-have of GitHub Reinforcement Learning repository (RL Algo, environements, papers, etc).

## Report
A first report (available in [french](https://github.com/LounesMD/Stage2021_RL/blob/main/CompteRendu.pdf) and soon in [english]()) proposed an in-dept study of some of the algorithms used. Note that the algorithms are not written because they are easily found on the internet. For the first version of the report, my work was based on this document : [Reinforcement Learning](https://philippe-preux.github.io/Documents/digest-ar.pdf).

## News
I am back to update this repository! From now on, you will have weekly RL papers with notes.<br>
Moreover, I intend to make this repository as useful as possible for myself as my goal is to do a PhD in RL in 1 or 2 years. So I will soon publish a list of all the RL researchers/teams and their research topics, as well as a list of major RL conferences! 

## To come
### <ins> Soon: </ins>
Q-Learning for inverted pendulum (some problems with discretization and busy for the moment...)<br>
Fitted Q-Iteration.  <br>
Deep Q-Learning. <br>

non-exhaustive list of what's coming soon: 
+ Algorithms:
  1. Fitted Q-Iteration
  2. Deep Q-Network
  3. REINFORCE
  4. PPO
  5. Quality-Diversity algorithms
+ Environment:
  1. Classic Control: Acroboy.
  2. Mujoco: Ant, Hopper and Humanoid.
  3. My own environments !
 
Also, I would like to provide a script, based on Deep-Q Learning, that can be run on *every* video game website to find the best way to *maximize* a score. <br>
At the beginning of 2023, you will have an object-oriented implementation of my algorithms (in comming). <br>
I will also try to read more *theoretical articles* and articles on RL.
 
## Papers
All the articles I've read and plan to read. I keep track of the teams involved so that I can get an idea of the research themes of RL teams around the world. <br>
